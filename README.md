# Automated Video Conversion Bot

* Background: My personal music practice sessions requires the use of an audio “slow-downer” software. The process requires the use of an online converter, and I discovered it took me a long time to do this. So, I wrote a Python script to automate the entire process. 
* Programming Tools: Selenium was my go-to! This project solidified my understanding of automated web testing.
